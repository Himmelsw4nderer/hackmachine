"""Lay out the Hackmachine desktop widgets on every screen, around what the wallpaper draws.

Reads one line per screen on stdin:  <containment id> <screen> <width> <height> <wallpaper.json>
and prints a Plasma script that (re)places the clock, system and apps cards on each desktop.

Everything sits on Plasma's 16px widget grid, the same grid the wallpaper cards are snapped to,
so widget frames land exactly where they are asked to and line up with the cards.

Landscape: the wallpaper owns the right-hand column (cheat-sheet, whoami) and the banner bottom-right.
           The widgets fill the left in two rows lined up with that column: clock + apps level with
           the cheat-sheet, then the system card from the whoami card's top down to above the banner.
Portrait:  the wallpaper owns the top (cheat-sheet, whoami) and the bottom (banner), so the widgets
           stack in the band between them, as wide as the cards: clock, apps, system.

usage: layout.py APPS_JSON MENU_COMMAND PANEL_RESERVE remove|add < screens

Run "remove" first and "add" a moment later: widgets removed in the same script still hold their
spot while they fade out, and Plasma would shove the new ones aside.
